
lang(Languages) specifies the language of the text content in that element. This attribute is primarily used for improving accessibility of the webpage.
We should always have the meta tag for the charset encoding of the webpage in the head element: <meta charset="utf-8">.
Another element we should always include in the head of an HTML document is the title element: <title>  </title>, title is not shown in the content of webpage

BASIC TEMPLATE!

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My first webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    My First Webpage!
</body>
</html>

Main CONTENT---
HTML data starts under the section named body, displayed using <body>....</body>.
HTML includes headers such as <h1> <h2>....<h6>....</h1></h2></h7> (THEY ALL DIFFER IN SIZE).
It also includes paragraphs; we represent them with  <p>...</p> (No such thing as P1 or p2; only one size for all).
WE bold text using - <strong>  </strong>  // <b> can also be used but it does not provide a meaning to text, so its better to use strong.
To italicize we use- <em>....</em>
