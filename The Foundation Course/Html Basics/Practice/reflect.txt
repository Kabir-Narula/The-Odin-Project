lang specifies the language of the text content in that element. This attribute is primarily used for improving accessibility of the webpage.
We should always have the meta tag for the charset encoding of the webpage in the head element: <meta charset="utf-8">.
Another element we should always include in the head of an HTML document is the title element:

TEMPLATE!

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My first webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    My First Webpage!
</body>
</html>
we have header such as <h1> <h2>....<h6>(opening)       </h1></h2></h7> (closing)
we have paragraphs; we represent them with  <p> </p>
To bold we use - <strong>  </strong>
To italics we use- <em> </em>
